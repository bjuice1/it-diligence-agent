# Executive Summary

*Investment Committee Ready*

**Overall Complexity:** HIGH
**Estimated Investment:** $4M-$6M
**Timeline:** 18-24 months
**Recommendation:** Proceed With Caution

## Key Findings
- Complete platform mismatch requiring migration of AWS to Azure, RSA MFA to Microsoft, and Splunk/QRadar to Sentinel
- Geographic concentration risk with both data centers in Chicago creating single point of failure for $500M revenue company
- Critical skills gap with only 1 cloud engineer supporting $3.38M AWS environment across 41 accounts
- Complex cross-domain dependencies creating 18-24 month integration timeline with 6-month critical path
- Strong application portfolio with modern SaaS adoption (67% cloud/SaaS) reducing application integration complexity
- Reasonable IT spend at 4.5% of revenue with $22.6M budget providing adequate investment capacity
- Partial Microsoft platform adoption provides foundation for buyer alignment in collaboration and identity

## Critical Risks
- Geographic concentration creates business continuity risk requiring immediate DR diversification ($800K-$1.2M)
- Platform migration complexity could extend timeline to 24+ months, increasing TSA costs by $500K-$1M
- Key person dependency on single cloud engineer creates execution risk if retention fails
- 41 AWS accounts with weak governance create security and compliance exposure during migration
- Sequential migration dependencies prevent parallel execution, creating critical path bottlenecks

## Immediate Actions (Pre-Close)
- Negotiate 18-24 month TSA with extension options to accommodate integration timeline
- Secure $4M-$6M integration budget with 25% contingency for platform migrations
- Engage Microsoft as strategic migration partner for Azure, Sentinel, and MFA transitions
- Initiate retention discussions with key IT personnel before announcement
- Commission detailed network and AWS architecture discovery to validate cost estimates

## Day 1 Requirements
- Establish secure network connectivity between target and buyer environments
- Provision buyer identity access for target IT team to begin integration work
- Set up integration PMO with dedicated program management and architecture resources
- Execute retention agreements for critical IT personnel, especially cloud and security teams
- Begin geographic diversification planning to address Chicago concentration risk

## Key Unknowns
- Detailed AWS resource inventory and actual migration complexity could increase costs by 25-50%
- Network architecture details may reveal additional connectivity requirements and costs
- Compliance requirements and certifications may mandate specific security controls during migration
- Application dependencies on current infrastructure may require extended parallel operations
