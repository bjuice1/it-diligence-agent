# SYNTHETIC IT DISCOVERY DOCUMENT
# Scenario 3: Carveout from Parent - Tests TSA/SEPARATION Detection
# Project Spinoff - Target Company: Global Logistics Division (of MegaCorp Inc.)
# Date: January 2026

================================================================================
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: This is a carveout with heavy parent dependencies.
The system should identify TSA requirements, separation complexity,
entanglement risks, and Day 1 continuity concerns.
================================================================================

SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE IT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Global Logistics Division ("GLD" or "Target") is being carved out from MegaCorp Inc.
GLD has 1,800 employees across 6 distribution centers. Currently, GLD is deeply
integrated with MegaCorp's shared services. Almost nothing is standalone.

## Critical Carveout Context
- Transaction Type: Carveout/Divestiture
- Seller: MegaCorp Inc. (Fortune 500)
- TSA Duration: Proposed 12 months (may be insufficient)
- Separation Complexity: HIGH

## What GLD Has (Standalone)
- Distribution center operations
- Some warehouse equipment
- Employee base
- Customer relationships

## What GLD Uses from MegaCorp (Shared)
- ALL IT infrastructure
- ERP (shared SAP instance)
- Email and collaboration
- Network connectivity
- Security operations
- HR systems
- Finance systems
- IT support

================================================================================
SECTION 2: INFRASTRUCTURE - PARENT PROVIDED
================================================================================

## Data Center / Hosting
- GLD has NO dedicated data center
- All servers run in MegaCorp's corporate data centers
- GLD workloads are on shared VMware clusters
- Cannot be easily identified/separated

## Network
- GLD sites connect via MegaCorp's global MPLS network
- No standalone internet at GLD sites
- All traffic routes through MegaCorp's firewalls
- GLD IP addresses are part of MegaCorp's 10.x.x.x scheme
- DNS: All GLD systems use corp.megacorp.com domain

## Identity
- GLD users are in MegaCorp's Active Directory
- OU: corp.megacorp.com/Users/Divisions/GLD
- No separate identity infrastructure
- SSO via MegaCorp's Okta tenant
- MFA provided by MegaCorp's Okta

## Endpoint
- GLD laptops are MegaCorp standard image
- MDM: MegaCorp's Intune tenant
- Endpoint security: MegaCorp's CrowdStrike
- Software deployment: MegaCorp's SCCM

================================================================================
SECTION 3: APPLICATIONS - ENTANGLEMENT DETAILS
================================================================================

## ERP (CRITICAL ENTANGLEMENT)

### SAP S/4HANA - Shared Instance
- MegaCorp runs single global SAP instance
- GLD is Company Code 3100 within shared client
- GLD transactions: ~40% of total SAP volume
- GLD master data mixed with corporate data
- Custom programs: 180+ used by GLD (shared codebase)
- Interfaces: 47 interfaces to/from GLD systems

### Data Entanglement Issues
- Customer master: Shared with other MegaCorp divisions
- Vendor master: Shared
- Material master: Shared
- GL accounts: MegaCorp's chart of accounts
- Intercompany transactions: Extensive (will need cleanup)

### Separation Options
1. Clone and separate: 6-9 months, $3-5M
2. New SAP instance: 12-18 months, $8-15M
3. Alternative ERP: 18-24 months, $5-10M

## Other Shared Applications

### Microsoft 365 (Shared Tenant)
- GLD users: 1,800 in MegaCorp's tenant
- Email: @megacorp.com domain
- SharePoint: GLD sites in MegaCorp's tenant
- Teams: Channels mixed with corporate
- OneDrive: Data in MegaCorp tenant
- Separation: New tenant required

### Workday HR (Shared)
- GLD employees in MegaCorp's Workday tenant
- Payroll: Processed through MegaCorp
- Benefits: MegaCorp plans
- Separation: Extract and migrate to new system

### Salesforce (Partially Shared)
- GLD has separate Salesforce org (GOOD)
- BUT: SSO via MegaCorp Okta
- AND: Some integrations to MegaCorp systems
- Lower separation complexity

### WMS (Standalone - GOOD)
- Manhattan Associates WMS
- Separate instance per distribution center
- Relatively standalone
- Needs connectivity to new ERP

================================================================================
SECTION 4: SECURITY - PARENT PROVIDED
================================================================================

## Security Stack (All MegaCorp)
- SIEM: MegaCorp Splunk (GLD logs in shared instance)
- EDR: MegaCorp's CrowdStrike (GLD in same tenant)
- Vulnerability Management: MegaCorp's Qualys
- Email Security: MegaCorp's Proofpoint
- PAM: MegaCorp's CyberArk (GLD privileged accounts)

## Security Operations
- SOC: MegaCorp's 24/7 SOC monitors GLD
- Incident Response: MegaCorp's IR team
- Security Policies: GLD follows MegaCorp policies
- No GLD-specific security staff

## Compliance
- SOC 2: GLD covered under MegaCorp's certification
- PCI: GLD covered under MegaCorp's program
- Post-separation: GLD will need own certifications

================================================================================
SECTION 5: ORGANIZATION - PARENT DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

## IT Staffing
- GLD Dedicated IT Staff: 8 FTEs
  - IT Manager: Reports to MegaCorp IT
  - Application Support: 4 (WMS focus)
  - Help Desk: 3 (Tier 1 only)
- All other IT provided by MegaCorp shared services

## Services Provided by MegaCorp IT
| Service | MegaCorp Team | GLD Dedicated |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Infrastructure | 0 | 0 |
| Network | 0 | 0 |
| Security | 0 | 0 |
| SAP Support | 0 | 0 |
| M365 Admin | 0 | 0 |
| Service Desk L2/L3 | 0 | 0 |
| Project Management | 0 | 0 |

## Knowledge Gaps
- No one in GLD understands infrastructure
- SAP knowledge: 0 in GLD
- Security knowledge: 0 in GLD
- Network knowledge: 0 in GLD

================================================================================
SECTION 6: TSA REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

## Proposed TSA Services

### Critical (Must Continue Day 1)
| Service | Duration | Monthly Cost | Exit Complexity |
|---------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| SAP Hosting & Support | 18 months | $180K | HIGH - no alternative ready |
| Network Connectivity | 12 months | $45K | MEDIUM - can provision new |
| Email & M365 | 12 months | $35K | MEDIUM - tenant migration |
| Security Operations | 12 months | $75K | HIGH - need to build |
| HR/Payroll | 6 months | $25K | LOW - can move to ADP |
| Service Desk | 12 months | $40K | MEDIUM - can outsource |

### TSA Risks
1. **Duration may be insufficient**
   - SAP separation typically 12-18 months
   - TSA proposed at 12 months
   - Risk of extension fees or rushed separation

2. **Service Level Degradation**
   - MegaCorp may deprioritize GLD after close
   - No incentive for quality post-sale
   - SLAs need strong enforcement

3. **Data Entanglement**
   - MegaCorp retains some GLD data
   - GDPR/privacy implications
   - Data extraction costs unclear

4. **TSA Exit Costs**
   - Not yet negotiated
   - MegaCorp may charge premium
   - Budget risk: +20-40% over estimates

================================================================================
SECTION 7: DAY 1 REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

## Must Work Day 1 (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Employee Authentication**
   - Users must log in
   - Currently: MegaCorp AD
   - Options: TSA or accelerated identity standup

2. **Email**
   - Must send/receive email
   - Currently: MegaCorp M365
   - Options: TSA (simplest for Day 1)

3. **ERP Access**
   - Finance must close books
   - Operations must process orders
   - Currently: MegaCorp SAP
   - Options: TSA only (no alternative)

4. **WMS**
   - Warehouses must operate
   - Currently: Standalone (GOOD)
   - Risk: Connectivity to SAP

5. **Payroll**
   - Employees must be paid
   - Currently: MegaCorp Workday
   - Options: TSA, then migrate

## Day 1 Risks
- Network cutover timing
- DNS changes (megacorp.com to new domain)
- Badge access (physical security systems)
- Phone system (currently MegaCorp VoIP)

================================================================================
