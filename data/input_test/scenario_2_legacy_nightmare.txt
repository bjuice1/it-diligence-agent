# SYNTHETIC IT DISCOVERY DOCUMENT
# Scenario 2: Legacy Nightmare - Tests MAXIMUM COMPLEXITY SIGNALS
# Project Phoenix - Target Company: Heritage Industrial Corp

The system should flag MANY CRITICAL risks, detect ALL complexity signals,
and generate EXTENSIVE work items. This tests maximum detection capability.
