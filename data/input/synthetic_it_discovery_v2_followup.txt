FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUEST RESPONSES
================================================================================

This document contains responses to due diligence questions submitted following
the initial IT discovery review.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: AS/400 LEGACY SYSTEM - DETAILED INFORMATION
================================================================================

## Current State (Expanded Details)
The AS/400 system (IBM iSeries Model 720) was originally deployed in 1989 and
has been continuously modified. Key details:

- Operating System: IBM i 7.3 (upgraded 2019)
- Programming Languages: RPG III, COBOL, CL
- Lines of Code: Approximately 2.4 million lines
- Database: DB2 for i, 847 tables, 12TB of data
- Integrations: 23 batch interfaces to SAP (nightly)
- Custom Reports: 340+ active report programs

## Developer Situation - CRITICAL UPDATE
We need to disclose that our AS/400 developer, Harold Jenkins (age 67):
- Has announced formal retirement effective March 31, 2027
- Has declined extended consulting arrangement post-retirement
- Has NOT documented approximately 60% of the custom modifications
- Is the ONLY person who understands the warehouse allocation logic

We attempted to hire a replacement but:
- Received zero qualified candidates in 6-month search
- RPG/AS400 skills are extremely scarce in the market
- Local consulting firms quoted $350/hour minimum

## Replacement Project Status
A preliminary assessment by Deloitte in 2024 estimated:
- Full replacement cost: $3.2M - $4.5M
- Implementation timeline: 18-24 months
- Risk: HIGH due to undocumented business logic

This project is currently UNFUNDED as management did not approve the investment.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: SECURITY INCIDENT DETAILS - EXPANDED
================================================================================

- Incident NOT disclosed to cyber insurance carrier
- Policy may have been violated (notification within 72 hours required)

## Additional Security Concerns Identified

During document gathering, we identified the following previously undisclosed items:

1. **Shadow IT Discovery**: Audit found 23 unsanctioned SaaS applications
   - Including file sharing services with company data
   - 3 applications contained customer information

2. **Privileged Access Issues**:
   - 14 IT staff have domain admin rights
   - 3 former employees still had active accounts (now remediated)
   - Service accounts with non-expiring passwords: 127 accounts

3. **OT/ICS Vulnerabilities**:
   - Manufacturing PLCs are running outdated firmware
   - Engineering workstations have direct internet access
   - No network segmentation between IT and OT networks
   - Last OT security assessment: Never performed

================================================================================
SECTION 3: DISASTER RECOVERY - HONEST ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

## DR Capability Reality Check

Following your questions, we conducted an internal review and must provide
a more accurate picture:

### SAP DR Capability
- Database is replicated to AWS, but...
- Application servers are NOT replicated
- Last successful replication test: Q1 2023 (data only)
- Estimated actual RTO: 5-7 business days (not 48-72 hours as stated)
- DR runbook is 18 months out of date

### Manufacturing Systems (FactoryTalk)
- ZERO disaster recovery capability
- Single points of failure in every plant
- If Columbus data center fails, all 12 plants would halt production
- Estimated production loss: $2.8M per day

### Backup Gaps Discovered
- 12 file servers are NOT included in Veeam backup scope
- These servers contain ~8TB of engineering drawings and specifications
- Last known backup of these servers: Tape backup from 2021

### Insurance Implications
- Business interruption coverage: $50M limit
- Cyber insurance: $10M limit
- Waiting period: 24 hours
- Current state likely does NOT meet policy requirements for DR

================================================================================
SECTION 4: TECHNICAL DEBT & DEFERRED MAINTENANCE
================================================================================

## Infrastructure Age Analysis
After detailed review, we provide the following asset age breakdown:

### Servers Beyond Vendor Support

- 8 servers running Windows Server 2008 R2 (completely unsupported)
- 3 SQL Server 2012 instances (extended support ended April 2022)

### Network Equipment
- 40% of access switches are Cisco Catalyst 2960 series (end-of-sale 2020)
- Core UPS system batteries: 6 years old (replacement recommended at 4 years)
- Backup generators: Last load test failed (December 2024)
  - Repair estimated at $180K, currently unfunded

### Application Technical Debt
- Hyperion (Oracle EPM): Running version from 2018, 3 versions behind
- Custom .NET applications: 8 applications still on .NET Framework 4.5
- API integrations: 45% use deprecated authentication methods

## Deferred Maintenance Backlog
We estimate the following to address critical deferred maintenance:

| Server refresh | $1.2M | Critical |
| Network refresh | $800K | High |
| Generator repair | $180K | Critical |
| UPS batteries | $95K | High |
| Application updates | $650K | Medium |
| **TOTAL** | **$2.925M** | |
