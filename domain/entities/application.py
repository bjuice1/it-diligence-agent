⚠️  DEPRECATED - OLD POC CODE

This is the original proof-of-concept Application aggregate from commit dccf49c.

DO NOT USE THIS FILE. It imports from deleted modules (value_objects).

For Worker 2 (Application domain), refer to:
- domain/kernel/ - Canonical primitives (Entity, Observation, FingerprintGenerator)
- domain/applications/ - Newer application domain implementation (if exists)

This file is kept temporarily for reference only.

Status: DEPRECATED
Replacement: domain/kernel/ (Worker 1) + domain/applications/ (Worker 2)
Scheduled for deletion: After Worker 2 complete
