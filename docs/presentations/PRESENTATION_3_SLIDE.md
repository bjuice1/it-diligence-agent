# Slide 1: The Problem We Solve

## IT Due Diligence Today Is Broken

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Manual** | 80+ hours per deal reading documents |
| **Inconsistent** | Quality varies by consultant |
| **Expensive** | $150-300K per engagement |
| **Slow** | 3-4 weeks delays deal velocity |

## The Brain on Top

We don't compete on data extraction. We add the **intelligence layer** that turns data into deal insights.

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   VDR DOCS      │     │    AI BRAIN     │     │  DEAL-READY     │

└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

**Key Differentiator:** Every finding cites evidence. No hallucination. Show your work.

# Slide 3: The Business Case

## Why This Matters for Returns

### Deal Velocity

| Approach | Timeline |
|----------|----------|
| Traditional IT DD | 3-4 weeks |
| With AI Brain | 3-5 days |

**Result:** Faster decisions, competitive advantage in auctions

---

### Cost Protection

| Benefit | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Surface hidden costs** | Integration costs before LOI |
| **Identify synergies** | Consolidation opportunities quantified |
| **Evidence trail** | Negotiation leverage with data |

---

### The North Star: Costs

Every deal comes down to two questions:

1. **What does IT really cost?**
   - Headcount + Non-headcount
   - Benchmarked against industry

2. **What will integration cost?**
   - One-time + Ongoing changes
   - Phased by timeline
   - Range estimates (low/mid/high)

## Summary

| Traditional IT DD | AI-Powered IT DD |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Weeks of reading | Hours of analysis |
| Consultant-dependent | Consistent methodology |
| Data dumps | Insight-first reports |
| "Trust me" | Evidence-backed |

**We are the brain on top.**
